-   **Schedule / Events page**
    -   Upcoming events – (use a table)
    -   include a day, time and location (Zoom/ Skype / WhatsApp / etc.) for each event you add to the table. – include a hyperlink if required.
    -   add a minimum of four events, for example: Swapping of Lego Minifigures; Big builds; or Speed builds.

        -   Preference of Lego sets – e.g. Lego City, Technic, Star Wars – should have option of selecting more than one choice
        -   Interest in taking part in competitions
    -   Submit and Cancel buttons
    -   Use https://webdevcit.com/displayvalues.php to verify that your form sends the data from the form to the server – **very important**

    -   Map (embedded from Google Maps, make up the address)

    -   List of Frequently Asked Questions.

### Requirements

1. All content must be marked up using HTML5.
2. All text must be your own.
3. All the styling should be in **ONE** external CSS file. All your HTML pages must be linked to this **CSS** file. **No inline or embedded styling permitted**.
4. Addressing to resources (CSS file, images and other web pages) must use relative addressing.
5. Use CSS for the layout of the site. Tables may not be used for layout but may be used for suitable content.
6. Consider using a suitable colour palette.
7. Pages must be **HTML5** and **CSS3** compliant. Validate your pages and CSS files with http://validator.w3.org and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator
8. **You must have at least 1 page with a three column CSS layout**. Instead of three columns of text, consider using images in your three column layout
9. There should be **persistent navigation** on each page. Every page should be accessible from every other page. **Navigation should be a horizontal navigation bar**.
10. Every page should contain a "**housekeeping**" section e.g. contains copyright information and contact details for the website's developers.
11. You should demonstrate use of **contextual selectors** and **pseudo-classes**.
12. Consider responsiveness in your website, making it work on different screens and screen resolutions.
13. Try to include images that you have taken yourself.
14. Any images that you use from other websites must be referenced properly. The referencing can be included in the code as a comment beside the image code. Please note that using google.com as the source of the image is **NOT** sufficient. The exact web page URL for the image must be included in the comments.
15. If you are looking for icons, please refer to reliable websites such as http://iconspedia.com paying particular attention to the licenses. For example, if the license requires attribution for the icon, then please include it in your website. Do not use Google's Image Search to search for icons because you cannot be sure of the associated licenses.
16. Consider **accessibility** especially when creating the website paying particular attention to forms (connect labels to form elements OR use aria-label attribute, and other ARIA attributes). Validate the webpages using the validation tool at http://wave.webaim.org/.

Create a zip file of the folder containing your HTML pages, CSS file, and all
images required for your website, and upload it through Canvas.
